<h1>🚀 WebPortfolio! 🌐</h1>

I’ve just completed a stunning web portfolio as part of Rocketseat’s exercises! 🎉 In this project, I practiced CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a fluid and organized layout. The portfolio is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes 📱💻, so it looks great on any device!

This was a challenging yet rewarding experience that helped me sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsiveness. 💪
